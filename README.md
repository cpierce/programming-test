Web Page
- Create a web page in PHP that uses the two MySQL tables above "colors" and "votes".
- The left column should be populated from reading all the entries in the colors table.
- The colors should be links, so that when you click on it, an Ajax call populates the Votes (obtained from MySQL) in the right column next to the color.
- When clicking on "Total", use Javascript only (no server involvement) to add up and present the totals shown.
- Write something that you would feel comfortable shipping and maintaining.
