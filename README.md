# Web Page

1. Create a web page in PHP that uses the two MySQL tables above "colors" and "votes".

2. The left column should be populated from reading all the entries in the colors table.

3. The colors should be links, so that when you click on it, an Ajax call populates the Votes (obtained from MySQL) in the right column next to the color.

4. When clicking on "Total", use Javascript only (no server involvement) to add up and present the totals shown.

5. Write something that you would feel comfortable shipping and maintaining.


The code in the files are what I have written from scratch from the above project test.  This allows you to see my skills in MySQL, PHP, CSS and HTML 5.  I took the liberty of optimizing the MySQL file from what it is here to better use indexes, etc.
